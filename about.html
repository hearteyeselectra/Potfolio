      <p>My name is Yazmin Ortega and IÊ¼m 15 years old.
      I've majored in Digital Media in Cab Calloway School of
      the Arts
      for my middle school and High School career. Additionally,
      I've had some experience with promoting online shops.
      My hobbies include: singing and writing, it's as simple as
      that.
      As a graphic artist, I'd like to enrich my knowledge of
      various applications. However, as a writer, I'd like to
      travel the world and write about my amazing experiences
      from anywhere but Delaware. As a singer, I'd like to grasp
      all the opportunities there are to belt my heart out and
      sing about things that make me (and others) happy. But,
      lastly, as a teenager, I'd like to take all of my
      knowledge and put it into what makes me, well, me.</p> </font>

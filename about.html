    <p> Me, Myself and I </p>

    <p2>My name is Yazmin Ortega and IÊ¼m 15 years old.
       I've majored in Digital Media in Cab Calloway School of the Arts
       for my middle school and High School career. Additionally,
       I've had some experience with promoting online shops.
       My hobbies include: singing and writing, it's as simple as that.
        As a graphic artist, I'd like to enrich my knowledge of various applications. However, as a writer, I'd like to travel the world and write about my amazing experiences from anywhere but Delaware. As a singer, I'd like to grasp all the opportunities there are to belt my heart out
        and sing about things that make me (and others) happy. But, lastly, as a teenager, I'd like to take all of my knowledge and put it into what makes me, well, me. </p2>
